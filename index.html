    Instructions: In this final summative project you will create a computer device using a microcontroller, electronic components and software that you will write using the Arduino/C++ programming language. Your project idea should incorporate at a minimum the following:
    Use of an ESP32, motor (servo or DC), wireless communication, button, switch or POT input, an I2C component and a use of a component not covered in this class but that is available (see the list below)

    Available components to add to your project(this may be updated as I discover/get more):
    Accelerometer, Relays, Joysticks, NeoPixel, Sonar Distance Sensor, Stepper Motors, Voltage Regulators, Touch Sensor, Temp-Humidity Sensor, Motion Sensor, IR Sensor, RGB LED, Photoresistors or Motor Drivers other than the L298N.

    For our summative project we decided to make a game; the game being Bop It (a game where you have to input something when the game tells you to). Uitlizing an OLED screen, an ESP32, buttons, resistors, wires and a RGB LEDs, bluetooth, a servo motor and battery, we created a wokwi and a physical version of our project. On this website you will be able to navigate your way to find a visual Wokwi circuit, a video explanation of the live build of the circuit and a web page file containing our code.

      <h2>Job: Circuit Designer</h2>
      For my role, I'm the circuit designer in charge of bringing our project to life. Using Wokwi, I carefully mapped out the circuit layout, deciding where to place buttons, LEDs, and all the essential components. In the live build, I'm hands-on, cutting wires, using zipties, and turning the digital plan into a tangible reality.
As part of the project, I provided a detailed explanation of how the device works, explaining each device used & the expected input/output (can be found on "wokwi" page).

      <h2>Job: The Coder</h2>
      I am the coder and was responsible for writing the code of the game and also the code connecting the software to the hardware. My main job was to implement the game logic and ensure it worked smoothly with the rest of the program. In addition to programming, I also had to explain the code clearly so that other team members or reviewers could understand how it worked (on "code" page).

      <h2>Job: Web Developer & Video Editor</h2>
      <!-- Coded website & created & edit video) -->
     For this project, I am the Web Developer & Video Editor. My responsibilty was to create, code and design this website as a way to present my team's (MAPHEAN) final summative project for the grade 12 Computer Engineering Class. My other task was to create and edit a video of the physical circuit. The video explains the physical build and how it works, using labels, titles, narration, etc (on "liveBuild" page).

      First is just initializing the libraries, Servo object and Servo pin number.

      Next, we setup the OLED display and declare the pin numbers for the LEDs and button.

      Now for the setup() function. All of this code runs once at the beginning of when the program starts. We first initialize the Serial as well as the PWMs
      ports, Dabble, Servo, and OLED. Most of this is just setup boilerplate like setting up the OLED formatting and allocating a timer for the ESP32.
    </p>

    <p class="illustration">
      Now for the first part of the loop() function. We first make sure we process the Dabble input at the start of each iteration of the loop. Then, we are going
      to pick a random number from 1-3 which will indicate which action we want the user to press. In this snippet, we see that if choice == 1, we turn
      on the orange LED (lvl1), display "Button" on the OLED, and then have the motor point towards the orange LED to indicate to the user that they have
      to press the button. Then with the delay() in the while loop we will proceed the stall/sleep the program until we receive an input from the button.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p class="illustration">
      Now for the second part of the loop() function, for if choice == 2. The logic pretty much stays the same except this time it will be the green LED in
      action, and the OLED will display "Triangle", showing the user that they must press the triangle button on the Dabble to proceed.
    </p>

    <img src="../code/5.png" class="illustration">
    <br>
    <p class="illustration">
      And now for the last part of the loop() function and the code, if choice == 3. Also follows pretty much the same logic but now it will be the red LED in
      action, the OLED will display "Circle", and the user will have to press circle on the Dabble to proceed.
